As of 2/23/2019:

Current code runs 6502 Functional test quite well, although doesn't
get to the end.  It gets into an infinite loop somewhere, that I've
not debugged.

That said, the kernal and basic seem to be working as the initial
screen comes out ok.  However, there is no flashing cursor.  I
expect that this is due to HW IRQ not working correctly.

It seems the IRQ should jump to the vector at ($FFFE), but I don't
see any RTI calls, just repeated IRQ calls.  Perhaps IRQ masking
is not working?

Some good information at:

ToDo
* Debug IRQ to get flashing cursor
* Add keyboard support
* Move from OpenGL to SDL?
* BCD mode
